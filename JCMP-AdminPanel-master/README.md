How To Make Yourself Administrator
<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> origin/development
Supplied, there is an 'admins.txt.example' file in the server folder. Rename this file to 'admins.txt' and input each Steam ID you want to be an administrator on each line.

If you don't know how to get your Steam ID, you can type /id in-game and it'll return with your Steam ID.

Type that Steam ID into the admins.txt and reload the script. You should now be marked as administrator.
